            This is a site intended to aid in the monitoring of Valve and it's negligence of updating one of the most
            amazing games to ever grace the world, Team Fortress 2. It's steam page ironically states "Constant updates", 
            meanwhile, Team Fortress 2 has not recieved a major content update for 5 continous years. We were promised a 
            Heavy Weapons Guy update. The community does it's utmost best
            to keep the game alive, god bless them. Every day since the last update, 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/DaysTf2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> this twitter account will upload a tweet,</a> counting the exact ammount of days it has been.

            Team Fortress is kept alive in a multitude of ways. Be it the modding community who create almost entirely new games from Team Fortress 2, 
            like Pre-Fortress 2, which is Team Fortress 2 before it was released, 
            Team Fortress 2 Classic which is a version of the <br> Original Team Fortress, but in Team Fortress 2, 
            or Open Fortress, which is basically Quake in Teamfortress!<br>
            <br>
            The next would be the artist of the Communty, who make Textures, Hats, Weapons, 
            Maps, and events for the the rest of the community to use and or play with, 
            many of their creations have made it officially into the game, many of which becoming some of the most beloved weapons, 
            cosmetics, or maps, sometimes even beating out the official items made by Valve.<br>
            <br>
            Lastly is that of the Content Creators, Youtubers and such. They create videos either showing off the works of the Artists, showing off crazy plays,
            new maps, making guides for beginners, talking about something in game, or giving us stuff to look forward too.
